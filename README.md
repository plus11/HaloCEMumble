Plugin to enable positional audio on Halo Custom Edition on Mumble (Tested with 32 bit)

- State value is set to 0 when in pause menu (positional audio is disabled in paused menu)
- Proper meter scale hasn't been determined placeholder used (Audio wont sound accurate based on the distance its coming from)
